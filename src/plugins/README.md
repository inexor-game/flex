-------------------

This is the Inexor plugin infrastructure. To bootstrap a plugin follow these simple steps

- add a new file called `YOURPLUGIN.js` in the plugins folder

The plugin file will be initialized automagically. It will have a `global.treeclient` library already initialized with which you can access inexor-flex.
See the sample plugin for instructions!
